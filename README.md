Final Project - Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning

Sub Genre Detection

Overview

This repository contains an unsupervised machine learning project. Movie Genres fail to capture accurate themes. They're too broad.Using Unsupervised Machine Learning it's possible to discover Sub-Genres. BERTopic will be used to to discover these granular genres without manual classication/labeling.
